They would have access to the best healthcare, and make decisions based on what is best for their physical and mental health. However, we do not live in a perfect world. There are too many factors at play, including but not limited to: the well-being of the fetus, the ability to pay for an abortion, the accessibility of safe abortion methods, and the stigmatization of women who have abortions. Because of these factors, the government should play a role in ensuring that women have safe and legal access to abortion. The government should ensure that all women have access to quality healthcare that includes counseling and safe abortion methods, regardless of their ability to pay. Furthermore, the government should remove the stigma associated with abortion so that women do not feel shame or guilt for seeking an abortion. Finally, the government should play a role in regulating the anti-abortion movement, which often uses misleading information and scare tactics to discourage women from seeking an abortion. In conclusion, while women should have the right to choose what to do with their bodies, the government must step in to ensure that women have safe and legal access to abortion, and that they are not subjected to the stigma associated with abortion.\n"
